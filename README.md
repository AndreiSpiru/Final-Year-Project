# Spiru Andrei-Tudor Final Year Project

Code for the final year project. This codebase is split into two parts:

# OpenPCDet

This section contains the detection frameworks, evaluation scripts and attack strategies. All new files are inside the **tools** subfolder and include a comment with the command needed to run them. Installation of the OpenPCDet library is required.

# MAVS

This section contains the code used for generating the datasets linked below. Some of the code was adapted from the SPAV examples provided with MAVS. Installation of the MAVS simulator is required.
